<h1>Task Tracker</h1>
<p>This site is created for COMP1006 - Intro to Web Programming using PHP for Winter 2022 - as a part of an assignment</p>
<p>Our task is to insert and select data from database and validate user inputs using PHP scripting.</p>
<p>I created a web application called Task Tracker where user can track their assignments, labs and quizzes' start and due dates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lamp.computerstudi.es/~Karen200266472/comp1006-php/tasktracker/">site</a> is hosted on LAMP stack for viewing</p>
